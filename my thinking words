never look at watch i've practiced for 3 hours i need to go back home i never i never did that. the biggest clock was my heart 
it was all about satisfaction. the time i felt that okay, today's day has been a productive one.because every morning when you leave home,
i feel every individual should leave with some expectations and when you come back home,you should come back with some experience which can only
help you become a better person,the best version of yourself, because when we start,you know,in that competition that rat race don't work
then you are following someone else's dreams.
